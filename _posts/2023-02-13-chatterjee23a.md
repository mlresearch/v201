title: Spatially Adaptive Online Prediction of Piecewise Regular Functions
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating piecewise regular functions in an
  online setting, i.e., the data arrive sequentially and at any round our task is
  to predict the value of the true function at the next revealed point using the available
  data from past predictions. We propose a suitably modified version of a recently
  developed online learning algorithm called the sleeping experts aggregation algorithm.
  We show that this estimator satisfies oracle risk bounds simultaneously for all
  local regions of the domain. As concrete instantiations of the expert aggregation
  algorithm proposed here, we study an online mean aggregation and an online linear
  regression aggregation algorithm where experts correspond to the set of dyadic subrectangles
  of the domain. The resulting algorithms are near linear time computable in the sample
  size. We specifically focus on the performance of these online algorithms in the
  context of estimating piecewise polynomial and bounded variation function classes
  in the fixed design setup. The simultaneous oracle risk bounds we obtain for these
  estimators in this context provide new and improved (in certain aspects) guarantees
  even in the batch setting and are not available for the state of the art batch learning
  estimators.
