title: Online Learning for Traffic Navigation in Congested Networks
abstract: We develop an online learning algorithm for a navigation platform to route
  travelers in a congested network with multiple origin-destination (o-d) pairs while
  simultaneously learning unknown cost functions of road segments (edges) using the
  crowd-sourced data. The number of travel requests is randomly realized, and the
  travel time of each edge is stochastically distributed with the mean being a linear
  function that increases with the edge load (the number of travelers who take the
  edge). In each step of our algorithm, the platform updates the estimates of cost
  function parameters using the collected travel time data, and maintains a rectangular
  confidence interval of each parameter. The platform then routes travelers in the
  next step using an optimistic strategy based on the lower bound of the up-to-date
  confidence interval. The key aspects of our setting include (i) the size and the
  spatial distribution of collected travel time data depend on travelersâ€™ routing
  strategies; (ii) we evaluate the regret of our algorithm for platforms with different
  objectives, ranging from minimizing the social cost to minimizing the individual
  cost of self-interested users. We prove that the regret upper bound of our algorithm
  is $O(\sqrt{T}\log(T)|E|)$, where $T$ is the time horizon, and $|E|$ is the number
  of edges in the network. Furthermore, we show that the regret bound decreases as
  the number of travelers increases, which implies that the platform learns faster
  with a larger user population. Finally, we implement our algorithm on the network
  of New York City, and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.
