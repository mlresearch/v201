title: Robust Estimation of Discrete Distributions under Local Differential Privacy
abstract: 'Although robust learning and local differential privacy are both widely
  studied fields of research, combining the two settings is just starting to be explored.
  We consider the problem of estimating a discrete distribution in total variation
  from $n$ contaminated data batches under a local differential privacy constraint.
  A fraction $1-\alpha$ of the batches contain $k$ i.i.d. samples drawn from a discrete
  distribution $p$ over $d$ elements. To protect the usersâ€™ privacy, each of the samples
  is privatized using an $\epsilon$-locally differentially private mechanism. The
  remaining $\alpha n $ batches are an adversarial contamination. The minimax rate
  of estimation under contamination alone, with no privacy, is known to be $\alpha/\sqrt{k}+\sqrt{d/kn}$.
  Under the privacy constraint alone, the minimax rate of estimation is $\sqrt{d^2/\epsilon^2
  kn}$. We show, up to a $\sqrt{\log(1/\alpha)}$ factor, that combining the two constraints
  leads to a minimax estimation rate of $\alpha\sqrt{d/\epsilon^2 k}+\sqrt{d^2/\epsilon^2
  kn}$, larger than the sum of the two separate rates. We provide a polynomial-time
  algorithm achieving this bound, as well as a matching information theoretic lower
  bound. '
