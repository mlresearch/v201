title: 'Optimistic PAC Reinforcement Learning: the Instance-Dependent View'
abstract: 'Optimistic algorithms have been extensively studied for regret minimization
  in episodic tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), both from a minimax and an
  instance-dependent view. However, for the PAC RL problem, where the goal is to identify
  a near-optimal policy with high probability, little is known about their instance-dependent
  sample complexity. A negative result of Wagenmaker et al. (2022) suggests that optimistic
  sampling rules cannot be used to attain the (still elusive) optimal instance-dependent
  sample complexity. On the positive side, we provide the first instance-dependent
  bound for an optimistic algorithm for PAC RL, BPI-UCRL, for which only minimax guarantees
  were available (Kaufmann et al., 2021). While our bound features some minimal visitation
  probabilities, it also features a refined notion of sub-optimality gap compared
  to the value gaps that appear in prior work. Moreover, in MDPs with deterministic
  transitions, we show that  BPI-UCRL is actually near instance-optimal (up to a factor
  of the horizon).  On the technical side, our analysis is very simple thanks to a
  new “target trick” of independent interest. We complement these findings with a
  novel hardness result explaining why the instance-dependent complexity of PAC RL
  cannot be easily related to that of regret minimization, unlike in the minimax regime. '
