title: 'Towards Empirical Process Theory for Vector-Valued Functions: Metric Entropy
  of Smooth Function Classes'
abstract: 'This paper provides some first steps in developing empirical process theory
  for functions taking values in a vector space. Our main results provide bounds on
  the entropy of classes of smooth functions taking values in a Hilbert space, by
  leveraging theory from differential calculus of vector-valued functions and fractal
  dimension theory of metric spaces. We demonstrate how these entropy bounds can be
  used to show the uniform law of large numbers and asymptotic equicontinuity of the
  function classes, and also apply it to statistical learning theory in which the
  output space is a Hilbert space. We conclude with a discussion on the extension
  of Rademacher complexities to vector-valued function classes. '
