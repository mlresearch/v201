title: Best-of-Both-Worlds Algorithms for Partial Monitoring
abstract: This study considers the partial monitoring problem with $k$-actions and
  $d$-outcomes and provides the first best-of-both-worlds algorithms, whose regrets
  are favorably bounded both in the stochastic and adversarial regimes. In particular,
  we show that for non-degenerate locally observable games, the regret is $O(m^2 k^4
  \log(T) \log(k_{\Pi} T) / \Delta_{\min})$ in the stochastic regime and $O(m k^{3/2}
  \sqrt{T \log(T) \log k_{\Pi}})$ in the adversarial regime, where $T$ is the number
  of rounds, $m$ is the maximum number of distinct observations per action, $\Delta_{\min}$
  is the minimum suboptimality gap, and $k_{\Pi}$ is the number of Pareto optimal
  actions. Moreover, we show that for globally observable games, the regret is $O(c_{\mathcal{G}}^2
  \log(T) \log(k_{\Pi} T) / \Delta_{\min}^2)$ in the stochastic regime and $O((c_{\mathcal{G}}^2
  \log(T) \log(k_{\Pi} T))^{1/3} T^{2/3})$ in the adversarial regime, where $c_{\mathcal{G}}$
  is a game-dependent constant. We also provide regret bounds for a stochastic regime
  with adversarial corruptions. Our algorithms are based on the follow-the-regularized-leader
  framework and are inspired by the approach of exploration by optimization and the
  adaptive learning rate in the field of online learning with feedback graphs.
