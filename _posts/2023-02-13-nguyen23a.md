title: Adversarial Online Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning
abstract: " We consider the adversarial online multi-task reinforcement learning setting,
  where in each of $K$ episodes the learner is given an unknown task taken from a
  finite set of $M$ unknown finite-horizon MDP models. The learnerâ€™s objective is
  to minimize its regret with respect to the optimal policy for each task. We assume
  the MDPs in $\\mathcal{M}$ are well-separated under a notion of $\\lambda$-separability,
  and show that this notion generalizes many task-separability notions from previous
  works. We prove a minimax lower bound of $\\Omega(K\\sqrt{DSAH})$ on the regret
  of any learning algorithm and an instance-specific lower bound of $\\Omega(\\frac{K}{\\lambda^2})$
  in sample complexity for a class of \\emph{uniformly good} cluster-then-learn algorithms.
  We use a novel construction called $\\emph{2-JAO MDP}$ for proving the instance-specific
  lower bound. The lower bounds are complemented with a polynomial time algorithm
  that obtains $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{K}{\\lambda^2})$ sample complexity guarantee for
  the clustering phase and $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{MK})$ regret guarantee for the learning
  phase, indicating that the dependency on $K$ and $\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}$ is tight."
