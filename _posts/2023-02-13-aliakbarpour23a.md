title: Testing Tail Weight of a Distribution Via Hazard Rate
abstract: 'Understanding the shape of a distribution of data is of interest to people
  in a great variety of fields, as it may affect the types of algorithms used for
  that data. We study one such problem in the framework of {\em distribution property
  testing}, characterizing the number of samples required to to distinguish whether
  a distribution has a certain property or is far from having that property. In particular,
  given samples from a distribution, we seek to characterize the tail of the distribution,
  that is, understand how many elements appear infrequently. We develop an algorithm
  based on a careful bucketing scheme that distinguishes light-tailed distributions
  from non-light-tailed ones with respect to a definition based on the hazard rate,
  under natural smoothness and ordering assumptions. We bound the number of samples
  required for this test to succeed with high probability in terms of the parameters
  of the problem, showing that it is polynomial in these parameters. Further, we prove
  a hardness result that implies that this problem cannot be solved without any assumptions. '
