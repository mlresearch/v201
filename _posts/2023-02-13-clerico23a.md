title: 'Wide stochastic networks: Gaussian limit and PAC-Bayesian training'
abstract: The limit of infinite width allows for substantial simplifications in the
  analytical study of over- parameterised neural networks. With a suitable random
  initialisation, an extremely large network exhibits an approximately Gaussian behaviour.
  In the present work, we establish a similar result for a simple stochastic architecture
  whose parameters are random variables, holding both before and during training.
  The explicit evaluation of the output distribution allows for a PAC-Bayesian training
  procedure that directly optimises the generalisation bound. For a large but finite-width
  network, we show empirically on MNIST that this training approach can outperform
  standard PAC- Bayesian methods.
