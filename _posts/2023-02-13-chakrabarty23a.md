title: A Query Algorithm for Learning a Spanning Forest in Weighted Undirected Graphs
abstract: 'We consider the problem of finding a spanning forest in an unknown {\em
  weighted} undirected graph when the access to the graph is via CUT queries, that
  is, one can query a subset $S\subseteq V$ of vertices and get the cut-value $\sum_{e\in
  \partial S} w(e)$ as the response. It is not too hard to solve this problem using
  $O(n\log n)$ queries mimicking a Prim-style algorithm using a binary-search style
  idea. In this paper we use the power of CUT queries to obtain a Monte-Carlo algorithm
  that makes $O(n\log \log n(\log\log\log n)^2)$ CUT queries. At the core of our contribution
  is a generalization of a result in [Apers et al., 2022] which studies the same problem
  on unweighted graphs, but to handle weights, we need to combine their ideas with
  ideas for {\em support estimation} of weighted vectors, as in [Stockmeyer, 1983],
  and {\em weighted graph reconstruction} algorithms, as in [Bshouty and Mazzawi,
  2012]. '
