title: Complexity Analysis of a Countable-armed Bandit Problem
abstract: We consider a stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem motivated by “large”
  action spaces, and endowed with a population of arms containing exactly $K$ arm-types,
  each characterized by a distinct mean reward. The decision maker is oblivious to
  the statistical properties of reward distributions as well as the population-level
  distribution of different arm-types, and is precluded also from observing the type
  of an arm after play. We study the classical problem of minimizing the expected
  cumulative regret over a horizon of play $n$, and propose algorithms that achieve
  a rate-optimal finite-time instance-dependent regret of $\mathcal{O}\left( \log
  n \right)$. We also show that the instance-independent (minimax) regret is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(
  \sqrt{n} \right)$ when $K=2$. While the order of regret and complexity of the problem
  suggests a great degree of similarity to the classical MAB problem, properties of
  the performance bounds and salient aspects of algorithm design are quite distinct
  from the latter, as are the key primitives that determine complexity along with
  the analysis tools needed to study them.
