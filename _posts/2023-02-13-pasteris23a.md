title: Perceptronic Complexity and Online Matrix Completion
abstract: We present an online algorithm for learning a binary relation, or equivalently
  the components of a binary-valued matrix. We derive mistake bounds for this algorithm
  that are based on a novel complexity measure called the perceptronic complexity.
  Informally, if we consider each row of the matrix as a separate learning task, then
  the perceptronic complexity is the Novikoff perceptron bound for learning the whole
  matrix when given the optimal kernel over the columns of the matrix. Our mistake
  bound is equal, up to a logarithmic factor, to the perceptronic complexity of the
  matrix plus the perceptronic complexity of its transpose. We show how this mistake
  bound asymptotically outperforms those of previous algorithms for the same problem,
  and give examples of our bound on natural families of matrices.
