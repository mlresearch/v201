title: Dealing with Unknown Variances in Best-Arm Identification
abstract: The problem of identifying the best arm among a collection of items having
  Gaussian rewards distribution is well understood when the variances are known. Despite
  its practical relevance for many applications, few works studied it for unknown
  variances. In this paper we introduce and analyze two approaches to deal with unknown
  variances, either by plugging in the empirical variance or by adapting the transportation
  costs. In order to calibrate our two stopping rules, we derive new time-uniform
  concentration inequalities, which are of independent interest. Then, we illustrate
  the theoretical and empirical performances of our two sampling rule wrappers on
  Track-and-Stop and on a Top Two algorithm. Moreover, by quantifying the impact on
  the sample complexity of not knowing the variances, we reveal that it is rather
  small.
