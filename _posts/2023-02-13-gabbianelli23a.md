title: Online Learning with Off-Policy Feedback
abstract: 'We study the problem of online learning in adversarial bandit problems
  under a partial observability model called off-policy feedback. In this sequential
  decision making problem, the learner cannot directly observe its rewards, but instead
  sees the ones obtained by another unknown policy run in parallel (behavior policy).
  Instead of a standard exploration-exploitation dilemma, the learner has to face
  another challenge in this setting: due to limited observations outside of their
  control, the learner may not be able to estimate the value of each policy equally
  well. To address this issue, we propose a set of algorithms that guarantee regret
  bounds that scale with a natural notion of mismatch between any comparator policy
  and the behavior policy, achieving improved performance against comparators that
  are well-covered by the observations. We also provide an extension to the setting
  of adversarial linear contextual bandits, and verify the theoretical guarantees
  via a set of experiments. Our key algorithmic idea is adapting the notion of pessimistic
  reward estimators that has been recently popular in the context of off-policy reinforcement
  learning.'
