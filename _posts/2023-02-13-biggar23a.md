title: The Replicator Dynamic, Chain Components and the Response Graph
abstract: In this paper we examine the relationship between the flow of the replicator
  dynamic, the continuum limit of Multiplicative Weights Update, and a game’s \emph{response
  graph}. We settle an open problem establishing that under the replicator, \emph{sink
  chain components}—a topological notion of long-run outcome of a dynamical system—always
  exist and are approximated by the \emph{sink connected components} of the game’s
  response graph. More specifically, each sink chain component contains a sink connected
  component of the response graph, as well as all mixed strategy profiles whose support
  consists of pure profiles in the same connected component, a set we call the \emph{content}
  of the connected component. As a corollary, all profiles are chain recurrent in
  games with strongly connected response graphs. In any two-player game sharing a
  response graph with a zero-sum game, the sink chain component is unique. In two-player
  zero-sum and potential games the sink chain components and sink connected components
  are in a one-to-one correspondence, and we conjecture that this holds in all games.
