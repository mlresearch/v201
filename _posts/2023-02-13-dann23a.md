title: Pseudonorm Approachability and Applications to Regret Minimization
abstract: Blackwell’s celebrated approachability theory provides a general framework
  for a variety of learning problems, including regret minimization. However, Blackwell’s
  proof and implicit algorithm measure approachability using the $\ell_2$ (Euclidean)
  distance. We argue that in many applications such as regret minimization, it is
  more useful to study approachability under other distance metrics, most commonly
  the $\ell_\infty$-metric. But, the time and space complexity of the algorithms designed
  for $\ell_\infty$-approachability depend on the dimension of the space of the vectorial
  payoffs, which is often prohibitively large. Thus, we present a framework for converting
  high-dimensional $\ell_\infty$-approachability problems to low-dimensional \emph{pseudonorm}
  approachability problems, thereby resolving such issues.  We first show that the
  $\ell_\infty$-distance between the average payoff and the approachability set can
  be equivalently defined as a \emph{pseudodistance} between a lower-dimensional average
  vector payoff and a new convex set we define. Next, we develop an algorithmic theory
  of pseudonorm approachability, analogous to previous work on approachability for
  $\ell_2$ and other norms, showing that it can be achieved via online linear optimization
  (OLO) over a convex set given by the Fenchel dual of the unit pseudonorm ball. We
  then use that to show, modulo mild normalization assumptions, that there exists
  an $\ell_\infty$-approachability algorithm whose convergence is independent of the
  dimension of the original vectorial payoff. We further show that that algorithm
  admits a polynomial-time complexity, assuming that the original $\ell_\infty$-distance
  can be computed efficiently. We also give an $\ell_\infty$-approachability algorithm
  whose convergence is logarithmic in that dimension using an FTRL algorithm with
  a maximum-entropy regularizer. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of our framework
  by applying it to several problems in regret minimization.
