title: 'Adaptive Power Method: Eigenvector Estimation from Sampled Data'
abstract: Computing the dominant eigenvectors of a matrix $A$ has many applications,
  such as principal component analysis, spectral embedding, and PageRank. However,
  in general, this task relies on the complete knowledge of the matrix $A$, which
  can be too large to store or even infeasible to observe in many applications, e.g.,
  large-scale social networks. Thus, a natural question is how to accurately estimate
  the eigenvectors of $A$ when only partial observations can be made by sampling entries
  from $A$. To this end, we propose the Adaptive Power Method (\textsc{APM}), a variant
  of the well-known power method. At each power iteration, \textsc{APM} adaptively
  selects a subset of the entries of $A$ to observe based on the current estimate
  of the top eigenvector. We show that \textsc{APM} can estimate the dominant eigenvector(s)
  of $A$ with squared error at most $\epsilon$ by observing roughly $O(n\epsilon^{-2}
  \log^2 (n/\epsilon))$ entries of an $n\times n$ matrix. We present empirical results
  for the problem of eigenvector centrality computation on two real-world graphs and
  show that \textsc{APM} significantly outperforms a non-adaptive estimation algorithm
  using the same number of observations. Furthermore, in the context of eigenvector
  centrality, \textsc{APM} can also adaptively allocate the observation budget to
  selectively refine the estimate of nodes with high centrality scores in the graph.
