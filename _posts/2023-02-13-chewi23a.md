title: On the complexity of finding stationary points of smooth functions in one dimension
abstract: We characterize the query complexity of finding stationary points of one-dimensional
  non-convex but smooth functions. We consider four settings, based on whether the
  algorithms under consideration are deterministic or randomized, and whether the
  oracle outputs $1^{\rm st}$-order or both $0^{\rm th}$- and $1^{\rm st}$-order information.
  Our results show that algorithms for this task provably benefit by incorporating
  either randomness or $0^{\rm th}$-order information. Our results also show that,
  for every dimension $d \geq 1$, gradient descent is optimal among deterministic
  algorithms using $1^{\rm st}$-order queries only.
