title: Efficient Global Planning in Large MDPs via Stochastic Primal-Dual Optimization
abstract: We propose a new stochastic primal-dual optimization algorithm for planning
  in a large discounted Markov decision process with a generative model and linear
  function approximation. Assuming that the feature map approximately satisfies standard
  realizability and Bellman-closedness conditions and also that the feature vectors
  of all state-action pairs are representable as convex combinations of a small core
  set of state-action pairs, we show that our method outputs a near-optimal policy
  after a polynomial number of queries to the generative model. Our method is computationally
  efficient and comes with the major advantage that it outputs a single softmax policy
  that is compactly represented by a low-dimensional parameter vector, and does not
  need to execute computationally expensive local planning subroutines in runtime.
