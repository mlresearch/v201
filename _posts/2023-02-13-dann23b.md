title: A Unified Algorithm for Stochastic Path Problems
abstract: 'We study reinforcement learning in stochastic path (SP) problems. The goal
  in these problems is to maximize the expected sum of rewards until the agent reaches
  a terminal state. We provide the first regret guarantees in this general problem
  by analyzing a simple optimistic algorithm. Our regret bound matches the best known
  results for the well-studied special case of stochastic shortest path (SSP) with
  all non-positive rewards. For SSP, we present an adaptation procedure for the case
  when the scale of rewards $B_\star$ is unknown. We show that there is no price for
  adaptation, and our regret bound matches that with a known $B_\star$. We also provide
  a scale adaptation procedure for the special case of stochastic longest paths (SLP)
  where all rewards are non-negative. However, unlike in SSP, we show through a lower
  bound that there is an unavoidable price for adaptation. '
