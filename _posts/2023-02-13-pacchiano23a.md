title: An Instance-Dependent Analysis for the Cooperative Multi-Player Multi-Armed
  Bandit
abstract: 'We study the problem of information sharing and cooperation in Multi-Player
  Multi-Armed bandits. We propose the first algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret
  for this problem when the collision reward is unknown. Our results are based on
  two innovations. First, we show that a simple modification to a successive elimination
  strategy can be used to allow the players to estimate their suboptimality gaps,
  up to constant factors, in the absence of collisions. Second, we leverage the first
  result to design a communication protocol that successfully uses the small reward
  of collisions to coordinate among players, while  preserving meaningful instance-dependent
  logarithmic regret guarantees. '
