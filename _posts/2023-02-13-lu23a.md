title: Projection-free Adaptive Regret with Membership Oracles
abstract: 'In the framework of online convex optimization, most iterative algorithms
  require the computation of projections onto convex sets, which can be computationally
  expensive. To tackle this problem HK12 proposed the study of  projection-free methods
  that replace projections with  less expensive computations. The most common approach
  is based on the Frank-Wolfe method, that uses linear optimization computation in
  lieu of projections. Recent work by GK22 gave sublinear adaptive regret guarantees
  with projection free algorithms based on the Frank Wolfe approach. In this work
  we give projection-free algorithms that are based on a different technique, inspired
  by Mhammedi22, that replaces projections by set-membership computations.  We propose
  a simple lazy gradient-based algorithm with a Minkowski regularization that attains
  near-optimal adaptive regret bounds. For general convex loss functions we improve
  previous adaptive regret bounds from $O(T^{3/4})$ to $O(\sqrt{T})$, and further
  to tight interval dependent bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{I})$ where $I$ denotes the interval
  length. For strongly convex functions we obtain the first poly-logarithmic adaptive
  regret bounds using a projection-free algorithm. '
