title: Tournaments, Johnson Graphs and NC-Teaching
abstract: Some years ago a teaching model, called “No-Clash Teaching” or simply “NC-Teaching”,
  had been suggested that is provably optimal in the following strong sense. First,
  it satisfies Goldman and Matthias’ collusion-freeness condition. Second, the NC-teaching
  dimension (= NCTD) is smaller than or equal to the teaching dimension with respect
  to any other collusion-free teaching model. Specifically the NCTD is upper-bounded
  by the recursive teaching dimension (= RTD). This raised the question about the
  largest possible gap between the NCTD and the RTD. The main results in this paper
  are as follows. First, we show that there exists a family $({\mathcal{C}})_{n\ge1}$
  of concept classes such that the RTD of ${\mathcal{C}}$  grows logarithmically in
  $n = |{\mathcal{C}}_n|$ while, for every $n\ge1$, the NCTD of ${\mathcal{C}}$ equals
  $1$. Since the RTD of a finite concept class ${\mathcal{C}}$ is generally bounded
  by $\log|{\mathcal{C}}|$, the family $({\mathcal{C}}_n)_{n\ge1}$ separates RTD from
  NCTD in the most striking way. Our first proof of existence of the family $({\mathcal{C}}_n)_{n\ge1}$
  makes use of the probabilistic method and random tournaments. But we also present
  a concrete family of concept classes (leading to a slightly smaller lower bound
  on $\mathrm{RTD}({\mathcal{C}}_n)$) which makes use of so-called quadratic-residue
  tournaments. Second, we characterize the maximum concept classes of NCTD $1$ as
  classes which are induced by tournaments in a very natural way. Third, we improve
  the previously best upper bound on the size of a maximum class of NCTD $d$ by a
  factor of order $\sqrt{d}$. The verification of the new upper bound makes use of
  Johnson graphs and maximum subgraphs not containing large narrow cliques. The connections
  between tournaments, Johnson graphs and NC-Teaching revealed here were not known
  before and might be considered interesting in their own right.
