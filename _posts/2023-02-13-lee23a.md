title: Convergence of score-based generative modeling for general data distributions
abstract: Score-based generative modeling (SGM) has grown to be a hugely successful
  method for learning to generate samples from complex data distributions such as
  that of images and audio. It is based on evolving an SDE that transforms white noise
  into a sample from the learned distribution, using estimates of the \emph{score
  function}, or gradient log-pdf. Previous convergence analyses for these methods
  have suffered either from strong assumptions on the data distribution or exponential
  dependencies, and hence fail to give efficient guarantees for the multimodal and
  non-smooth distributions that arise in practice and for which good empirical performance
  is observed. We consider a popular kind of SGM—denoising diffusion models—and give
  polynomial convergence guarantees for general data distributions, with no assumptions
  related to functional inequalities or smoothness. Assuming $L^2$-accurate score
  estimates, we obtain Wasserstein distance guarantees for \emph{any} distribution
  of bounded support or sufficiently decaying tails, as well as TV guarantees for
  distributions with further smoothness assumptions.
