title: Universal Bias Reduction in Estimation of Smooth Additive Function in High
  Dimensions
abstract: Suppose we observe $\mathbf{x}_j = \boldsymbol{\theta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_j$,
  $j=1,...,n$ where $\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is an unknown parameter
  and $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_j$ are i.i.d. random noise vectors satisfying some
  general distribution. We study the estimation of $f(\boldsymbol{\theta}):= \sum_{i=1}^d
  f_i(\theta_i)$ when $f:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a given smooth additive
  function and $d$ is large. Inspired by a recent work on studying the estimation
  of $f(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ under Gaussian shift model via a Fourier analytical
  approach, we propose a new estimator that can be implemented easily and computed
  fast. We show that the new estimator achieves effective bias reduction universally
  under minimum moment constraint. Further, we establish its asymptotic normality
  which implies the new estimator is asymptotically efficient. When $f_i$ is sufficiently
  smooth and $d$ is large, such properties make the new estimator rate optimal. Efficient
  computation of the new estimator and the minimum requirement of noise make this
  work more applicable to real world applications.
