title: Max-Quantile Grouped Infinite-Arm Bandits
abstract: In this paper, we consider a bandit problem in which there are a number
  of groups each consisting of infinitely many arms.  Whenever a new arm is requested
  from a given group, its mean reward is drawn from an unknown reservoir distribution
  (different for each group), and the uncertainty in the armâ€™s mean reward can only
  be reduced via subsequent pulls of the arm.  The goal is to identify the infinite-arm
  group whose reservoir distribution has the highest $(1-\alpha)$-quantile (e.g.,
  median if $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$), using as few total arm pulls as possible.  We
  introduce a two-step algorithm that first requests a fixed number of arms from each
  group and then runs a finite-arm grouped max-quantile bandit algorithm.  We characterize
  both the instance-dependent and worst-case regret, and provide a matching lower
  bound for the latter, while discussing various strengths, weaknesses, algorithmic
  improvements, and potential lower bounds associated with our instance-dependent
  upper bounds.
