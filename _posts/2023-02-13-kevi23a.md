title: Primal-Dual Algorithms with Predictions for Online Bounded Allocation and Ad-Auctions
  Problems
abstract: Matching problems have been widely studied in the research community, especially
  Ad-Auctions with many applications ranging from network design to advertising. Following
  the various advancements in machine learning, one natural question is whether classical
  algorithms can benefit from machine learning and obtain better-quality solutions.
  Even a small percentage of performance improvement in matching problems could result
  in significant gains for the studied use cases. For example, the network throughput
  or the revenue of Ad-Auctions can increase remarkably. This paper presents algorithms
  with machine learning predictions for the Online Bounded Allocation and the Online
  Ad-Auctions problems. We constructed primal-dual algorithms that achieve competitive
  performance depending on the quality of the predictions. When the predictions are
  accurate, the algorithms’ performance surpasses previous performance bounds, while
  when the predictions are misleading, the algorithms maintain standard worst-case
  performance guarantees. We provide supporting experiments on generated data for
  our theoretical findings.
