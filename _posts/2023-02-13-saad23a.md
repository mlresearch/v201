title: Constant regret for sequence prediction with limited advice
abstract: 'We investigate the problem of cumulative regret minimization for individual
  sequence prediction with respect to the best expert in a finite family of size K
  under limited access to information. We assume that in each round, the learner can
  predict using a convex combination of at most p experts for prediction, then they
  can observe a posteriori the losses of at most m experts. We assume that the loss
  function is range-bounded and exp-concave. In the standard multi-armed bandits setting,
  when the learner is allowed to play only one expert per round and observe only its
  feedback, known optimal regret bounds are of the order O(sqrt{KT}). We show that
  allowing the learner to play one additional expert per round and observe one additional
  feedback, improves substantially the guarantees on regret. We provide a strategy
  combining only p=2 experts per round for prediction and observing m \ge 2 experts’
  losses. Its randomized regret (wrt. internal randomization of the learners’ strategy)
  is of order O((K/m) log(K delta^{-1})) with probability 1- delta, i.e., is independent
  of the horizon T (“constant” or “fast rate” regret) if (p \ge 2 and m \ge 3). We
  prove that this rate is optimal up to a logarithmic factor in K. In the case p=m=2,
  we provide an upper bound of order O(K^2 \log(K delta^{-1})), with probability 1-delta.
  Our strategies do not require any prior knowledge of the horizon T nor of the confidence
  parameter \delta. Finally, we show that if the learner is constrained to observe
  only one expert feedback per round, the worst-case regret is the “slow rate” Omega(sqrt{KT}),
  suggesting that synchronous observation of at least two experts per round is necessary
  to have a constant regret. '
