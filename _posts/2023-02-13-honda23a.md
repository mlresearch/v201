title: Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader Achieves Best-of-Both-Worlds for Bandit Problems
abstract: This paper discusses the adversarial and stochastic $K$-armed bandit problems.
  In the adversarial setting, the best possible regret is known to be $O(\sqrt{KT})$
  for time horizon $T$. This bound can be achieved by several policies but they require
  to explicitly compute the arm-selection probabilities by solving optimization problems
  at each round, which becomes problematic in some settings. One promising candidate
  to avoid this issue is the Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy, which simply
  chooses the arm with the minimum cumulative estimated loss with a random perturbation.
  In particular, it has been conjectured that $O(\sqrt{KT})$ regret might be achieved
  by FTPL with a Fréchet-type perturbation. This paper affirmatively resolves this
  conjecture by showing that Fréchet perturbation indeed achieves this bound. We also
  show that FTPL achieves a logarithmic regret for the stochastic setting, meaning
  that FTPL achieves best-of-both-worlds regret bounds. The key to these bounds is
  the novel technique to evaluate the stability of the policy and to express the regret
  at each round in multiple forms depending on the estimated losses.
